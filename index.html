  <h1>Privacy Policy for the app “Interactive Physics Simulator”</h1>
  <p>Last updated: [29 12 2025]</p>

  <h2>1. Controller</h2>
  <p>
    [Prof. Dr. Henrich]<br>
    [Hoerigstrasse 26a]<br>
    [01157, Dresden, Germany]<br>

  </p>

  <h2>2. Data processing when downloading the app</h2>
  <p>
    When you download the “Physics Simulator” app, certain data are processed by the
    respective app store (Apple App Store). This may include in particular: your user name,
    e-mail address, customer number of the store, time of the download, payment information
    and the individual device identifier. We have no influence on this data processing; it is
    carried out solely under the responsibility of the store operator. For more details, please
    refer to the privacy policy of the respective store.
  </p>

  <h2>3. Data processing when using the app</h2>
  <p>
    The “Physics Simulator” app is used exclusively to run physical simulations
    (e.g. mechanics, electrodynamics, optics, medical physics).
    We <strong>do not collect, store or analyze any personal data of users</strong> within the app.
    In particular:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>No registration or login is required.</li>
    <li>No user profiles are created.</li>
    <li>No tracking for analytics or advertising purposes takes place.</li>
    <li>No location data are processed.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>App permissions</h3>
  <p>
    The app currently does not require access to the camera, microphone, contacts, photos
    or other personal content on the device.
  </p>

  <h2>4. Log data and crash reports</h2>
  <p>
    In the event of crashes, the device’s operating system (iOS) may transmit anonymized crash
    reports and usage statistics to Apple. These data may be made available to us in aggregated
    form via Apple’s developer platform (e.g. number of crashes, iOS version, device model),
    without us being able to identify you personally.
    The legal basis for this is our legitimate interest in the technical stability and improvement
    of the app (Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR).
  </p>

  <h2>5. Legal bases for processing</h2>
  <p>
    Insofar as we process personal data (for example, when you contact us by e-mail), this is
    based on Art. 6(1)(b) GDPR (performance of a contract or pre-contractual measures) or
    Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR (legitimate interest in answering enquiries and ensuring the operation
    of the app).
  </p>

  <h2>6. Disclosure of data / third-country transfers</h2>
  <p>
    We do not disclose personal data to third parties. Any processing by the app store
    (Apple) is carried out under the sole responsibility of that provider. A transfer of data
    to third countries cannot be ruled out in this context; please refer to the
    respective store’s privacy policy for details.
  </p>

  <h2>7. Storage period</h2>
  <p>
    If, in the course of using the app, personal data are processed in exceptional cases
    (e.g. within support enquiries via e-mail), such data are stored only for as long as is
    necessary to handle the enquiry or to comply with statutory retention obligations.
  </p>

  <h2>8. Your rights</h2>
  <p>Under the GDPR you have in particular the following rights:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Right of access (Art. 15 GDPR),</li>
    <li>Right to rectification (Art. 16 GDPR),</li>
    <li>Right to erasure (Art. 17 GDPR),</li>
    <li>Right to restriction of processing (Art. 18 GDPR),</li>
    <li>Right to data portability (Art. 20 GDPR),</li>
    <li>Right to object to certain processing activities (Art. 21 GDPR).</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    To exercise these rights or if you have any questions about data protection,
    you can contact the controller named above at any time.
  </p>

  <h2>9. Right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority</h2>
  <p>
    You also have the right to lodge a complaint with a data protection supervisory authority,
    in particular in the Member State of your habitual residence, place of work or place of the
    alleged infringement, if you consider that the processing of your personal data infringes
    the GDPR.
  </p>

  <h2>10. Changes to this privacy policy</h2>
  <p>
    We may amend this privacy policy if the app or the underlying processing operations change.
    The version published on this page shall always apply.
